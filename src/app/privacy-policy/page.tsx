      <h2>Cookies</h2>

      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep order records for as long as needed to provide our services and meet legal and accounting

      </p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your state of residence (for example, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia and others),
        you may have the right to access, correct, delete or obtain a copy of your personal information, and to opt
        out of certain processing. To make a request, email <a href={`mailto:${site.email}`}>{site.email}</a>. We will
